My fantasy cricket game project is a web-based game where users can create their own virtual teams of real-life cricket players and score points based on how those players perform in real matches. The goal of the game is to have the highest scoring team at the end of the season or tournament.

#Technology

The game is developed using Python and the PyQt5 GUI framework. The database is implemented using SQL.
